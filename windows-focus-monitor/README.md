# Focus Monitor
This powershell scripts monitors the focus / active window in Windows.

I've had this annoyance where my active window changes randomly, and I couldn't figure out what was causing it.

Created this powershell script in order to monitor which application / process id was stealing the focus.

# How to use
Open an elevated powershell window (run as Administrator)
Go to the path of the powershell script, and run it with
```./focus-monitor.ps1```

Code "as is". No warrenty.
